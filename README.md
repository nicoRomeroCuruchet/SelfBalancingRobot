# PPO for Self-Balancing Robot Control with ROS/Gazebo

This repository contains the implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm applied to control a self-balancing robot simulated in the ROS (Robot Operating System) and Gazebo simulation environment.

# Overview

The self-balancing robot is simulated in ROS/Gazebo, which provides an accurate simulation environment for testing and training the control algorithm. The PPO algorithm is a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method used to train the robot to maintain balance and make appropriate movements based on sensor feedback.

# Setup       
      git clone https://github.com/nicoRomeroCuruchet/SelfBalancingRobot.git
      cd SelfBalancingRobot
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      catkin_make
      source devel/setup.bash
      roslaunch self_balancing_robot main.launch
      
# Getting Started
Once compiled and with the robot running in the Gazebo simulator.
To train from scratch:

      python3 main.py

To test model:

      python3 main.py --mode test --actor_model ppo_actor.pth

To train with existing actor/critic trained models:

      python3 main.py --actor_model ppo_actor.pth --critic_model ppo_critic.pth
